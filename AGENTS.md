# Agent Instructions

Guidelines for AI agents working on this project.

## Working Agreement

- **Branching:** Create feature branches for non-trivial changes
- **Safety:** Never delete or overwrite files without confirmation
- **Testing:** Run tests after changes to core functionality
- **Documentation:** Update CLAUDE.md when new patterns emerge

## Quality Guidelines

- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Ask when requirements are ambiguous
- Document non-obvious decisions in code comments
- Keep changes focused and minimal

## Communication

- Be concise in explanations
- Show relevant code snippets when discussing changes
- Summarize what was done after completing tasks

## Before Making Changes

1. Understand the existing code structure
2. Check for related tests
3. Consider impact on other parts of the system
4. Ask if uncertain about the approach

## After Making Changes

1. Verify the change works as expected
2. Run relevant tests
3. Update documentation if behavior changed
4. Summarize what was modified
